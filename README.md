## Introduction
"Prevent - What you need to know" is website created in HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 5.3 and Javascript designed to outline the basic facts of the UK's Prevent program. Prevent is a an initiative intended to spot and support people who may be vulnerable to radicalisation. Its goal is to recognise early signs of concern, raise awareness, and connect people with the right help and guidance before issues escalate.

## UX
### Stories

### Wireframes

## Design
### Fonts

### Colours

### Images

### Favicons
My favicon is from an image generated by DALLE via ChatGPT, manipulated using [RealFaviconGenerator](realfavicongenerator.net). I was also able to use this as a bulletpoint.

### Content
All text content was generated by ChatGPT, with revisions designed to make the tone friendier and more informational.

## Features
### Highly responsive layout
The website features what I consider to be a highly responsive layout with three different configurations depending on screen size. In particular, the mobile layout is designed to encourage downwards- scrolling using the snaking whitespace left by the assymetric paragraphs. Upon scaling up, the right-justified paragraph resolves to the left.

### Header image
Smaller screens also feature a header image better suited to the narrower form factor than the image used on wider screens.

Quite elegantly, the header image is tinted using a CSS box-shadow inset and sized to cover the image entirely.

## Future scope
Further tweaks for this website will be to lessen the "primary" nature of the colours used in favour of a more closely grouped pallate.

Due to the timed element of this project I would like to be able to go back and improve the semantic layout of the site.

An idea I had that I did not have time to implement was to have the #maincontent section appear to sit behind the header, in a nested arrangement.

The overall tone of the site is a little mixed currently.

Finally, I am not satisfied with the amount of blank space shown on CL screens - this is mainly a limitation of Bootstrap's columns which cannot be 50% width with this design.


## Technologies used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Javascript
- Bootstrap 5.3
- Font Awesome

## Deployment

## Testing

#### Manual testing
Testing on all screensizes revealed that there the sheer amount of whitespace and lack of content (seen in above screenshots) left the site looking sparse, and like a whiteboard. This was resolved in the closing stages of the project.

#### HTML validation

#### CSS validation

#### Lighthouse testing

#### Unfixed bugs
I found in manual testing that, on mobile the ! bulletpoints sit on the second line, of their content when wrapped. This is due to them being placed as an ::after psuedo-class.
